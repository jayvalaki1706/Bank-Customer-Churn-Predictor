# Bank-Customer-Churn-Predictor
This repository hosts a Bank Churn Predictor developed using various machine learning algorithms and a deep learning sequential model, integrated within a Flask web application. The predictor aims to forecast customer churn for banking services. <br>

# Features:
*Multiple Model Integration* : Utilizes Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms alongside a Sequential Deep Learning model.<br>
*Flask Web App* : Integrates the predictive models into a user-friendly web application using Flask, allowing users to interact with the prediction system.<br>
*Churn Prediction* : Provides the likelihood of customer churn based on input features, empowering banks with proactive strategies for customer retention.<br>

# Technologies Used:
*Machine Learning* : Implemented with Python's ML libraries for Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.<br>
*Deep Learning* : Utilized Python's Sequential Model for deep learning integration.<br>
*Web Framework* : Flask was employed for creating the user interface and integrating predictive models into a web environment.<br>

# Achievements:
*Model Accuracy* : Achieved an accuracy rate of 86.56% in both the Sequential Model and SVM, showcasing robust predictive capabilities.<br>
*Comprehensive Approach* : Employed all available machine learning algorithms/models to ensure comprehensive analysis and comparison of predictive performance.<br>

# How it works:
*Model Selection* : Users can choose between different machine learning models or the deep learning sequential model for churn prediction.<br>
*Input Features* : The web interface prompts users to input relevant customer data for churn prediction.<br>
*Prediction* : Upon submission, the system processes the input data and provides a churn likelihood prediction based on the selected model.<br>
*Result Display* : Presents the predicted churn probability to the user through the web interface.<br>

# Usage:
*Setup* : Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.<br>
*Execution* : Run the Flask app to access the churn prediction system.<br>
*Interaction* : Input customer data and select a model for churn prediction.<br>
*Result* : View the predicted churn likelihood displayed on the web interface.<br>
